This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms .

At the same time , the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes , allowing a bolus of food to enter . Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus . These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself . Along with peristalsis , the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes . "}

Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years . "}

Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent , which remains in an unaltered form to the present day . However , the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air , hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high - ranking ( though not necessarily royalty ) in China . On at least one occasion , twenty - four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting . The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland .

{"id": 9084604251611519852, "question": "why does cooling water run through the condenser", "doc": "Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems . "}

Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation . "}
